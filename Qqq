Subject: Urgent Request for Updating Joining Status on PM Internship Portal

Respected ma'am,

My name is Preetam Kumar Chaurasiya, PMIS Registration ID 522322, Internship ID PMIS-2025-26503. I was allotted the joining location IDZ Harahua under TCS iON for my internship.

As per the information received through the official app, my joining date is 25/06/2025 and reporting date is 18/06/2025. However, despite repeated follow-ups, my joining status is still not updated on the PM Internship Portal. Every time, I am informed that it will be updated within 1â€“2 days, but it has not happened till now.

Due to this delay, I have already discontinued my college journey and have not pursued further studies, keeping in view my internship commitment. This situation is causing me mental stress and uncertainty about my future career prospects.

Therefore, I kindly request you to immediately update my joining status on the PM Internship Portal and provide me with an official confirmation, so that I can continue my internship without any further issues.

I shall be highly obliged for your prompt action in this matter.

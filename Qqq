Subject: Request for One More Chance for 2025_IA R1_30 Nov 26 CAT Exam

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to humbly request your kind consideration regarding my recent 2025_IA R1_30 Nov 26 CAT Exam attempt.

Due to an oversight from my side, I could not notice that only one attempt was allotted for the exam. Additionally, I failed to pay proper attention to the remaining time during the test. Because of this, I was unable to complete the exam and unfortunately failed.

I sincerely apologize for this mistake.
I request you to kindly grant me one more chance to appear for the exam. I assure you that I will be more careful and attentive during my next attempt.

Your support in this matter will be greatly appreciated.
Please consider my request and allow me an additional attempt.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
